## The R package `optimall`

* R has great tools for the *analysis* of complex survey data (`survey` package), but less for the *design*.

--

* **optimall** is an R package for the survey design process of stratified sampling surveys. It is particularly useful for multi-phase and multi-wave designs.

--

* Objective: Streamline the design and implementation process of stratified survey sampling in R.

    * Automate basic steps including defining strata and selecting samples.

    * Simplify steps for optimum sample allocation with Neyman or Wright algorithms.

    * Reduce potential for error and enhance reproducibility. 
    
    * Provide a structure for organization of multi-phase and multi-wave surveys.

---
## Installing the package

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("yangjasp/optimall")
```

* Will be submitted to CRAN soon.

---
## Notable functions in **optimall**: The basics

* `split_strata()` and `merge_strata()`:

    * Create sampling strata based on values or quantiles of auxiliary variables.
--

* `optimum_allocation()`

    * Determine the optimum allocation of samples to minimize the variance of a sample mean.
    
    * Implement Wright or Neyman allocations.
    
--

* `sample_strata()`

    * Randomly select specific samples according to sampling design specified manually or by `optimum_allocation`. 

---

## Notable functions in **optimall**: Shiny app

* `optimall_shiny()`

    * Loads an app for interactively adjusting strata cut points.
    
    * Reactively observe effects on stratum size and allocation.

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Image of optimall shiny app inputs. Options to select column names, split  type, split location, confirm the split", fig.align = "center", include = FALSE, out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jasper/Downloads/figure3.png")
```

## Optimall shiny app

```{r figure1a, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Image of optimall shiny app inputs. Options to select column name", fig.align = "center", out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jasper/Desktop/SummerWork2020/Practiceproj/optimall/inst/shiny-app/optimall_shiny/Screenshots/Screenshot1.png")
```
---
## Notable functions in **optimall**: Multi-wave sampling
    
* `allocate_wave()`:

    * Apply optimum allocation to a multi-wave survey.
    
    * Determine optimum allocation for a sampling wave taking into account sampling of previous waves.
    
    * Adjusts for oversampling. Sometimes the true optimum allocation is not possible so we must approximate.
---
## Organizing multi-wave surveys

* Multiwave object

    * A single object that holds all of the survey information for every phase and wave of a study including metadata, samples, sampled data, designs.

```{r figure2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Image of Multiwave Object Organization. Boxes connected by arrows show how phase 1 contains data and metadata. Phase 2 contains multiple waves, each with samples, sampled_data, design, data, metadata.", fig.align = "center", out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jasper/Downloads/figure6.png")
```

## Summary
* The **optimall**  R package is a new tool for streamlining the design and implementation process of stratified survey sampling in R. It is designed to be useful for surveys ranging from simple to complex.
